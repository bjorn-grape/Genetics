# Practical C# monogame & genetic algorithm

The purpose of this project is to implement genetic algoritm in order to complete a 2d
platformer game.
This is meant to be completed by first year students after they learned all the
basis about OOP in C#.

A pdf tutorial should be linked with the code in order to explain everything to the students.

The monogame library is supposed to be crossplatform

If you want to use this code, please mention this Repo.
All the images, sprites and musics are not from me, links to them should be added soon.
